I am siyabonga Vilakazi,
I am teaching myself to develop websites using asp.net core MVC, html, css, Javascript,Ajax,Bootstrap,sql and Microsoft Azure.
I hold a 3 year Bachelors of Science degree majoring with Physics and Electrical engineering  Subjects which I completed in 2021. 
When I was still at University, I managed to enroll for a 1 year c# course plus 4 months of Data structures and algorithms.
I developed interest in coding and decided to enroll for extra courses in udemy during holidays, to learn about web development.
I am currently working on my ecommerce website, which I have been building for 5 plus months while learning Asp.net core MVC. I chose to build an ecommerce website because it seemed to 
be challenging, therefore it has helped me to nourish my coding skills.
