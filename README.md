I am Siyabonga Vilakazi.  
I taught myself the front end and the back end of web development.  
In the front end I have strong skills in Javascript,html and css.   
In the back end I rely on Asp.net Core MVC.  
For databases I undestand and know most SQL syntax, but for my websites I prefer EF Core.
